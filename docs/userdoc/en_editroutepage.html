    <p>At this page you can create and edit a route.</p>
    <p>There is always a currently selected point within the route. It is marked
      red on the chart and marked grey in the list on the left side. You can
      change the selected point by clicking a different point on the chart or in
      the list on the left side.<br>
      If you are editing the currently active route, the route info at the left
      side will display a red border (otherwise green).<br>
      Leaving the editor will take you back to the active route.</p>
    <p>All changes become effective immediately - there is no undo.</p>
    <p>At the left side you see a list of all the route's waypoints including
      courses and distances. On top of the list the number of waypoints, the
      overall route length and - if the route is active - the estimated ETA are
      displayed.<br>
      By clicking an already selected waypoint in the list you open an edit
      dialog to change its name or position.</p>
    <h2><a name="routedialog" id="routedialog"></a>EditRoute Dialog</h2>
    <p> Clicking on the route info on the left side or the <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/menu_open.svg"

            locally.<br>
            The dialog will also include an Upload button to load a route that

    <h3>Name Dialog</h3>
    <p>From the EditRoute dialog some actions will bring up a name dialog to
      select a new name for a route.</p>
    <img src="editroutepage-namedialog.png" alt="" class="fimage">

    <h2>Route Point Buttons</h2>
    <p>Clicking the bottom left panel activates some additional buttons. </p>
    <p><img src="editroute-wpbuttons.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>

    <p>Using this Feature Info you could create routes that contain your
      favorite way points, add them as overlay and use them to insert way points
      into routes that you create.<br>
      Hint: To only display the points of a route just set the line width of the
      overlay to 0.</p>
    <h2><a name="connectedmode" id="connectedmode"></a>Connected and
      Disconnected Mode</h2>
    <p>If you switch off the <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/plug.svg" alt=""
        class="inlineimage" style="color:red;">ConnectedMode on the mainpage
      (showing a <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/plug-disconnect.svg" alt=""
        class="inlineimagered">disconnect icon in the title) this basically
      means you cannot change items that are stored on the server. This also
      includes routes. You still can create new routes or modify routes that you
      created while being disconnected.<br>
      The intention is to give you the option to play with alternative routes
      (including activating them) without interfering with the server.<br>
      When you leave the disconnected mode and a (different) route is active on
      the server this will also become locally.</p>
    <p>The <a href="#routedialog">EditRoute dialog</a> will show you the
      information whether a route is stored on the server and if you currently
      can write the route.<br>
      If you try to edit a route that is stored on the server while in
      disconnected mode you will get a warning.</p>
    <p><img src="editroutepage-disconnected.png" alt="" class="fimage"> </p>
    <p>In this case just click "OK" (will bring up the <a href="#routedialog">EditRoute
        dialog</a>) and e.g. create a copy using "Save As".<br>
      By default the "Load" action in the EditRoute dialog will only provide you
      the list of routes you currently can write (but you could also load a read
      only route to display it).</p>
    <p>When you created a route in disconnected mode it will be stored locally
      in your Browser. To copy it to the server return to connected
      mode,&nbsp; open the local route in the route editor and make a change -
      this will automatically push the route to the server.</p>
    <p>If you start a route in disconnected mode small <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/plug-disconnect.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimagered">disconnect icons will be shown in various
      widgets. The content of those widgets in this case is only valid for your
      local display and e.g. does not affect the NMEA data (like RMB/APB) that
      the server will send.</p>
